# 🛡️ **Password Manager** 🔐

Welcome to the **Password Manager** project! This simple yet secure password manager helps you store and manage your passwords in a safe and easy-to-use GUI. Built using Python's **Tkinter** module, it's designed for simplicity and functionality. 🖥️

## 🏗️ **Project Structure**
- **main.py**: The main Python file that powers the password manager's functionality. It provides the logic for storing, displaying, and retrieving passwords. 
- **data.txt**: A text file that securely stores your passwords (it is encrypted, but make sure to keep it safe!).
- **logo.png**: The logo used in the GUI interface to give the project a sleek design. 🎨

## 💻 **Features**  
✨ **Simple UI** – Built with **Tkinter**, providing a clean and intuitive graphical interface.  
🔑 **Password Storage** – Allows you to securely store passwords for multiple accounts.  
🔒 **Encryption** – Passwords are stored in a text file, but be sure to handle the file carefully.  
📋 **Easy Access** – Quickly retrieve and manage your stored passwords.  

## 🚀 **How to Use**
1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/password-manager.git
